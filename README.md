explain as much of the issue as possible, and send screenshots.<br>

<br>
<h2 align="center">disclaimer</h2>

any reprocussions coming from usage of this tool aren't my fault or my issue, so don't bug me.<br>
i'd recommend using a vpn when spamming Blooket's API.

<br>
<h2 align="center">speed</h2>

i tried to make the tool as speedy as possible with promises and threading, but there seemed to be issues every method i tried.<br>
ratelimiting seems to be a problem and i don't want to add proxies to this tool.<br>
if someone finds a successful method, please open a PR and share!

<br>
<h2 align="center">credit</h2>

i stole the firebase join info from [konz](https://github.com/05konz).<br>
other than those few lines, i coded the entire thing.
